# oss-setup

Some things are slightly difficult to automate,
so I still have some manual installation steps,
but at least it's all documented here.

## TODOS

- A template that generate oss-internal
- A cron script do `sudo chmod a+rw /var/run/docker.sock` on all rancher/k8s hosts
- Fix CI build on github forked projects
